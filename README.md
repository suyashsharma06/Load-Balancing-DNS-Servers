2. The Client connected to LS which actually added as the Client in Project 1 since it had established connection with both the TS1 and TS2. After a specific time interval, if the input is still found to be null, then the lookup address is marked with error, otherwise the IP Address is displayed.

3. No issues that I know of.

4. I feel there was a lot of time gap between the last project and this project because of which I feel I kinda forgot how I had implemented the code base. So one major challenge was to go through the code base again and try understand what it was previouslt doing and what changes to it could satisfy the requirements of Project - 2.

5. A little bit more of Python and how the DNS Lookup work.
